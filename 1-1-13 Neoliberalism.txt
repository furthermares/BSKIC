> **[Neoliberalism]** - A world of new and unusual economic system
  End of the Cold War meant fall of Communism and victory for Capitalism. Capitalism spread quickly without Communism, and after 1991 the world went through capitalization for around 30 years. But Capitalism after the Cold War changed. Capitalism before the Cold War was a system with interfering government after the Great Depression. But after the Cold war, government interference was criticized. Capitalism system criticizing government interference and pursuing free market is called ‘Neoliberalism’.
We haven’t talked about economics yet, so how Late Capitalism (Modified Capitalism) and Neoliberalism are different or why we’re trying to differentiate them may be hard to understand at this moment. But it’s quite easy once you read the [Economics] chapter, and naturally understand why we must differentiate the two.
But what we must remember, is that solo reign of Capitalism hasn’t been around for a long time. Of course, there could be people among the readers who were born after the disbandment of the Soviet Union who haven’t thought about the possibility outside of Neoliberalism. But whatever happens, one thing that’s certain is it is not a universal nor stable system that has lasted for few centuries. Considering it is a short economic system that has only been around for 30 years, and thousands of years of human history, we’re living in a very unusual economic system.

Because of our inherent limitation of us having to live as ourselves and not others, people interpret the world in their own way with him/her in the center. People understand the world only as much as they experienced. So, when we think of the past, we think they must’ve been like us. Think similarly, feel similarly, and spend similarly. But that’s not the truth. The world we live in is a very unique and unprecedented world of very consuming and market-oriented Neoliberalism. People in the past who didn’t live in Neoliberalism must’ve live very differently. They must’ve thought differently from us, felt differently, and lived differently. It is important to know that the world we’re living in is not the average usual life in the human history thus far. Then we can objectively view our unusual selves in our unusual world. Understanding distorted ‘me’ in a distorted ‘world’, is the most basic preparation for intellectual conversations.
