> **[Modern Capitalism]** - New power is born

The Modern Capitalism era extends from about 18C to the end of WW2, 1945, around 200 years. After the change of means of production (from manor to factory and capital), the ruling power class shifted from king and lords to bourgeoisie. Social class structure was also reorganized. It was divided into two classes. Bourgeoisie who owned means of production, and Proletariat, who didn't. Bourgeoisie were also called citizens, but not proletariat. Does that mean proletariat are not citizens? Technically yes. The citizen here doesn't mean people living in some kind of city. Citizen in the social class sense is a class who has economic power and so pays taxes and participates in politics, and only bourgeoisie had citizenships.

Society became very simple. Class is decided on whether you own the means of production or not. Owning the means of production made a huge difference in daily lives and social roles. Bourgeoisie not only had no problem surviving but also able to constantly accumulate wealth. On the other hand, proletariats had no means of production, so they had to struggle. How do they survive? They have nothing, so they have to sell the only thing they have - their bodies. To whom? Factory owners. They had to sell his their labour power to capitalists, in exchange for a wage.
  We've already talked about what the wage workers receive actually means. To summarize, Bourgeoisie gains product from proletariat's labour power, takes the profit from selling the said product, then give workers wage the amount of what he sees fit. It was proletariat who worked, but people who accumulates wealth are bourgeoisie. The reason I repeat is because this is the essence of conflict of modern society problems. Company owners make effort to lower the cost for employees, and focuses on maximizing their profit. On the other hand, the employees who works in said company always feel their salary are low compared to how hard they worked, and to increase it they correspond to it by him or herself or en masse. Early modern period or today, the essence of problem doesn't change.

We checked from ancient to modern period by focusing on 'change of means of production' and 'owners of means of production'. Now let's move on to modern and contemporary periods.
