> **<Midway Checkpoint>**
Our journey following human history started from Primitive Communism to Ancient Slave society to Medieval Feudalism. The most important core idea was 'means of production'. As the time progressed, means of production changed from land-manor-factory, and its owner class king-lord-bourgeoisie. History can be explained by simple structure of social class conflict by means of production.

The remaining stops are Modern and Contemporary era. To understand them means of production is not enough. We need something else. And that is 'the nature of Capitalism'. Modern and contemporary era kept and developed an economic structure called capitalism. So its nature is embedded in its society, and transformed it.
  Our journey continues from Modern Capitalism.
