> **[The Age of Imperialism]** - They needed colonies
  Countries which became Capitalist through Industrial revolution inevitably faced with problems with oversupply, so they needed to pioneer new markets. The best way to do it is colonization. This is the direction many industrialized countries in Europe had to follow. The most prominent example England went to India, Spain to South America, France to Africa; they competed with each other to establish colonies.
  There's one country we have to pay attention and it's Germany. Germany's industrialization speed was quick but was too busy with civil war about feudalism to push it. After their unification they also went through industrialization and faced with oversupply problem. Like other countries they had to secure new market. But because they were late, there were no colonies to pioneer - they were already taken by then. It was an emergency for Germany.
  Then opportunity struck. Germany's ally Austria's prince got assassinated in Russia, and with this Austria declared war on Serbia, and Germany declared war on Russia. WW1 has started.
